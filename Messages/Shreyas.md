Hi Giri,

Really happy to have had you in my team, you had joined into a team with a lot innovative work happening around digital initiatives. The responsibilies and expectations were extremely high, but you still took up the challenge and made your mark. Devices were an amazing addition to the digital pillars and looking forward for this legacy being carried forward.

Apart from all the amazing work you have done you have also made a mark in the team with your very lively personality, your readiness to participate in a plan, play TT, have some fun conversations, experiment with veg food will always be in my memory.... truly you were an asset for the team and it saddens me to say goodbye earlier, but I wish you the best of luck for your future, you will do super well I am confident !!!

Thanks for all the hard work.
