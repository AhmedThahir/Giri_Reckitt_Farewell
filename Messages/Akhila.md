Hey Giri

Can't begin to tell you how much of a help you have been to resolve my digital hiccups. I appreciate your prompt responses asking me to send an email explaining the issue to you and Shreyas, which again takes away another good 10 minutes of my time apart from the time already lost on the glitch.

Jokes apart- glad you were here to help us whenever we required it the most! Cant wait to see you at greater heights!
