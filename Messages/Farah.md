Heyy Giri 👋🏼

You’ve been such an amazing person and it’s really upsetting to have to say goodbye to a great colleague like you! Thank you for being super helpful and approachable always and I really wish that you excel in whatever you do next, wherever you are 😊

I hope that our paths cross again in the future and I wish you all the best and success in your life 😊 Take care and stay in touch!
