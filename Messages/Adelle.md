Hi Giri, it's sad to see you go!! 

You've been super helpful to me (even with the silly requests ) and you've been a cool colleague. I have seen you work so hard especially when you built those loggers from scratch!! I know you're going to have a very successful career ahead -- don't lose the creativity.

Thanks for everything again!
